<br><font size=+2><b>B. Verbs</b></font><br><br>

<b>Monads and Dyads. </b> Verbs have two definitions, 
one for the <i>monadic</i> case (one argument), 
and one for the <i>dyadic</i> case (two arguments).  
The dyadic definition applies if the verb is preceded by 
a suitable left argument, that is, any noun that is not itself 
an argument of a conjunction; otherwise the monadic definition applies.<br><br>

The monadic case of a verb is also called a <i>monad</i>, 
and we speak of the <i>monad</i><tt> % </tt>used in the 
phrase<tt> %4</tt> ,<tt> </tt>
and of the <i>dyad</i><tt> % </tt>used in<tt> 3%4</tt> .<tt> </tt>
Either or both may have empty domains.<br><br>

<b>Ranks of Verbs.</b>  The notion of verb rank is closely 
related to that of noun rank: a verb of rank <i>k</i> applies 
to each of the k-cells of its argument.  
For example (using the array<tt> b </tt>from
<a href="dicta.htm">Section A</a>):<br>

<pre>
   ,b
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx

   ,&quot;2 b                         ,&quot;_1 b
abcdefghijkl                  abcdefghijkl
mnopqrstuvwx                  mnopqrstuvwx
</pre>

Since the verb <i>ravel</i> (denoted by<tt> ,</tt>)
applies to its entire argument, its rank is said to be <i>unbounded</i>.  
The <i>rank</i> conjunction<tt> &quot; </tt>used in the phrase<tt> ,&quot;2 </tt>
produces a related verb of rank 2 that ravels each of the 2-cells 
to produce a result of shape 2 by 12.<br><br>

The shape of a result is the frame (relative to the cells to which 
the verb applies) catenated with the shape produced by applying 
the verb to the individual cells.  
<a name="fill"></a>
Commonly these individual shapes agree, but if not, 
they are first brought to a common rank 
by introducing leading unit axes to any of lower rank, 
and are then brought to a common shape by 
<i>padding</i> with an appropriate <i>fill</i> element:  space for a character 
array,<tt> 0 </tt>for a numeric array, and a boxed empty list 
for a boxed array.  For example: <br>

<pre>
   i.&quot;0 s=: 2 3 4                &gt;'I';'was';'here'
0 1 0 0                       I
0 1 2 0                       was
0 1 2 3                       here
</pre>

The dyadic case of a verb has two ranks, governing the 
left and right arguments.  For example:<br>

<pre>
   p=: 'abc'
   q=: 3 5$'wake read lamp '
   p,&quot;0 1 q
awake
bread
clamp
</pre>

Finally, each verb has three intrinsic ranks: 
monadic, left, and right.  The definition of any verb need specify 
only its behaviour on cells of the intrinsic ranks, and 
the extension to arguments of higher rank occurs systematically.  
The ranks of a verb merely place upper limits on the ranks of 
the cells to which it applies; its domain may include 
arguments of lower rank.  For example, <a href="d131.htm">Matrix Inverse (<tt>%.</tt>)</a>
has monadic rank 2, but treats the case of a vector as 
a one-column matrix.<br><br>

<b>Agreement. </b> In the phrase<tt> p v q</tt>,<tt> </tt>
the arguments of<tt> v </tt>must <i>agree</i> in the sense that one 
frame must be a prefix of the other, as in<tt> p,&quot;0 1 q </tt>above, 
and in the following examples:<br>

<pre>
   p ,&quot;1 1 q                     3 4 5 * i. 3 4
abcwake                        0  3  6  9
abcread                       16 20 24 28
abclamp                       40 45 50 55

   (i.3 4) * 3 4 5
 0  3  6  9
16 20 24 28
40 45 50 55
</pre>

If a frame contains<tt> 0</tt>,<tt> </tt>the verb is applied 
to a cell of fills.  For example:<br>

<pre>
   ($ #&quot;2 i. 1 0 3 4);($ 2 3 %&quot;1 i. 0 2)
+---+---+
|1 0|0 2|
+---+---+

   ($ $&quot;2 i. 1 0 3 4);($ 2 3 %/&quot;1 i. 0 4)
+-----+-----+
|1 0 2|0 2 4|
+-----+-----+
</pre>
