</span>1. <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]>Introduction</span></span></a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>This book will tell you enough about J for you to use it
as a language for developing serious applications, but it is about more than
learning the J language: it is also about 'thinking big' in programming, and how
programming in J is fundamentally different from programming in C.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>C programs deal intimately with scalars
(single numbers and characters), and even when they combine those scalars into
arrays and structures, the operations on the arrays and structures are defined
by operations on the scalars.&nbsp; To ensure
that each item of an array is operated on, loops are created that visit each
element of the array and perform a scalar operation on the element.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Writing code in a scalar language makes you rather like a
general who gives orders to his troops by visiting each one and whispering in
his ear.&nbsp; That touch-of-Harry kind of
generalling can achieve victorious results, and it has the advantage that the
orders can be tailored to the man, but its disadvantages are significant: the
general spends much mental energy in formulating individual orders and much
breath in communicating them individually; more significant, his limited
attention is drawn toward individuals and away from the army as a whole.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Even the great Rommel was overtaxed at times.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The J programmer is, in contrast, a general who stands
before his army and snaps out orders to the army as a whole.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Every man receives the same order, but the
order itself contains enough detail for the individual men to act
appropriately.&nbsp; Such a general can
command a corps as easily as a platoon, and always has the 'big picture' in
mind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>OK, maybe you're not Rommel, but you are a working
programmer, and you suspect that very few practical programs can be represented
as array operations--matrix multiplication maybe, or adding a list of
numbers--and that, even if a wide range of programs were possible, the set of
operations supported must be too vast to be practical: wouldn't we need an
array operation for every possible program?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The first half of this book is devoted to showing you that
it is indeed possible to write meaningful programs with array operations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>We take the approach of looking at the
different ways loops are used, and seeing what facilities J has for producing
the same result using array operations.&nbsp;
We will find that J contains a couple of dozen array-processing
primitives and a dozen or so very cleverly chosen pipe-fittings that allow
those primitives to be connected together to provide the limitless supply of array-processing
functions needed for practical programming.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Interspersed with the elaboration of more and more
intricate array operations are treatments of other matters of use in practical
programming: structure definition, input and output, performance measurement,
calling DLLs, modular programming.&nbsp;
Eventually we will see how to use if-then-else and do-while in J, though
you will have learned more elegant ways to get the same results.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The last portion of the book is devoted to the optional
topic of <i>tacit programming</i>, J's language for functional
programming.&nbsp; Tacit programming is an
extremely terse way of expressing algorithms, one that allows programs that
have been compressed from a page of C into a few lines of J to be compressed
still further.</p>
