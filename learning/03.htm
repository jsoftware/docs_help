<H1>Chapter 3: Defining Functions</H1>
J comes with a collection of functions built-in; we have seen a few, 
such as <TT>*</TT> and <TT>+</TT>.
In this section we take a first look at how to put together these built-in 
functions, 
in various ways, for the purpose of defining our own functions.
<H2>3.1  Renaming</H2>
The simplest way of defining a function is to give a name of our own choice to a built-in function. 
The definition is an assignment.  
For example, to define <TT>square</TT> to mean the 
same as the built-in <TT>*:</TT> function: 
<PRE>
<TT>   square =: *:</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
<TT>   square 1 2 3 4</TT>
<TT>1 4 9 16</TT>
</PRE>
We might choose to do this if we prefer  our own name as more memorable. 
 We can give two different names to the same built-in function, 
intending to use one for the monadic case and the other for the dyadic.
<PRE>
<TT>   Ceiling =: >.</TT>
<TT>   Max     =: >.</TT>
</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>

<TD><TT>2</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>4</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
<A NAME="02"></A>
<H2>3.2  Inserting</H2>
Recall that <TT>(+/ 2 3 4)</TT> means <TT>2+3+4</TT>, 
and similarly  <TT>(*/ 2 3 4)</TT> means <TT>2*3*4</TT>. 
We can define a function and give it a name, say <TT>sum</TT>, with an assignment:
<PRE>
<TT>   sum =: + /</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
<TT>   sum 2 3 4</TT>
<TT>9</TT>
</PRE>
Here, <TT>sum =: +/</TT> shows us that <TT>+/</TT> is by itself an expression
which denotes a function.
<p>
This expression <TT>+/</TT> can be understood as: "Insert" <TT>(/)</TT>
applied to the function <TT>+</TT> to produce a list-summing function.
<p>
That is, <TT>/</TT> is itself a kind of function. It takes one argument,
on its left. Both its argument and its result are functions. 
<A NAME="03"></A>
<A NAME="04"></A>
<A NAME="05"></A>
<H2>3.3  Terminology: Verbs, Operators and Adverbs</H2>
We have seen functions of two kinds. Firstly, there are "ordinary" functions, such as <TT>+</TT> and <TT>*</TT>,
which compute numbers from numbers.  
In J these are called "verbs".
<p>
Secondly, we have functions, such as <TT>/</TT>, which compute functions from functions.
Functions of this kind will be called "operators", to distinguish them from verbs.
<p>
Operators  which take one argument are called "adverbs".  An adverb always takes its
 argument on the left.  Thus we say that in the expression <TT>(+ /)</TT> the adverb <TT>/</TT> is applied to
the verb <TT>+</TT> to produce a list-summing verb.
<p>
The terminology comes from the grammar of English sentences: verbs act upon things and
 adverbs modify verbs. 
<A NAME="06"></A>
<H2>3.4  Commuting</H2>
Having seen one adverb, <TT>(/)</TT>, let us look at another.
The adverb <TT>~</TT> has the effect of exchanging
left and right arguments. 
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>'a' , 'b'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>'a' ,~ 'b'</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>ab</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>ba</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
The scheme is that for a dyad <TT>f</TT> with arguments <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT>
<PRE>
<TT>             x f~ y      means    y f x</TT>
</PRE>
For another example, recall the residue verb
<TT>|</TT> where <TT>2 | 7</TT> means, in conventional notation, 
"7 mod 2". We can define a <TT>mod</TT> verb:
<PRE>
<TT>   mod =: | ~</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>7 mod 2</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>2 | 7</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>1</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>1</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
Let me draw some pictures. 
Firstly, here is a diagram of function <TT>f</TT>
applied to an argument <TT>y</TT> to produce a result <TT>(f y)</TT>.  In the diagram
the function <TT>f</TT> is drawn as a rectangle and the arrows 
are arguments flowing into, or results 
flowing out of, the function. Each arrow is labelled
with an expression. 
<p>
<IMG SRC="diag01.gif" ALT="diagram 01" WIDTH=196 HEIGHT=197><BR>
Here is a similar diagram for a dyadic
<TT>f</TT> applied to arguments <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> to
produce <TT>(x f y)</TT>.
<p>
<IMG SRC="diag02.gif" ALT="diagram 02" WIDTH=233 HEIGHT=233><BR>
Here now is a diagram for the function <TT>(f~)</TT>, which can be pictured as containing
inside itself the function <TT>f</TT>, together
with a crossed arrangement of arrows. 
<p>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="diag03.gif" ALT="diagram 03" WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=240><BR>
<A NAME="07"></A>
<H2>3.5  Bonding</H2>
Suppose we wish to define a verb <TT>double</TT> such that <TT>double x</TT> means <TT>x * 2</TT> . 
That is, <TT>double</TT> is to mean "multiply by 2".   We define it like this:
<PRE>
<TT>   double =: * &amp; 2</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
<TT>   double 3</TT>
<TT>6</TT>
</PRE>
Here we take a dyad, <TT>*</TT>, and produce from it a monad by fixing 
one of the two arguments at a chosen value (in this case, 2).  
The <TT>&amp;</TT> operator is said to form a bond between a function and 
a value for one argument. 
The scheme is: if <TT>f</TT> is a dyadic function, and <TT>k</TT> is a value for the
 right argument of <TT>f</TT>,  then  
<PRE>
<TT>            (f &amp; k) y    means    y f k  </TT>
</PRE>
Instead of fixing the right argument we could fix the left, so we also have 
the scheme
<PRE>
<TT>            (k &amp; f)  y   means    k f y</TT>
</PRE>
For example, suppose that the rate of sales tax is 10%, 
then a function to compute the tax, from the purchase-price is:
<PRE>
<TT>   tax =: 0.10 &amp; *</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
<TT>   tax 50</TT>
<TT>5</TT>
</PRE>
Here is a diagram illustrating function <TT>k&amp;f</TT>.

<A NAME="08"></A>
<A NAME="09"></A>
<H2>3.6  Terminology: Conjunctions and Nouns</H2>
The expression <TT>(*&amp;2)</TT> can be described by
saying that the <TT>&amp;</TT> operator is a function which is applied 
to two arguments  
(the verb <TT>*</TT> and the number <TT>2</TT>), and the result is
the "doubling" verb.
<p>
A two-argument operator such as <TT>&amp;</TT> is called in J a "conjunction", because
it conjoins its two arguments. 
By contrast, recall that adverbs are operators with only one argument.
<p>
Every function in J, whether built-in or user-defined,
 belongs to
exactly one of the four classes:
monadic verbs,
dyadic verbs,
adverbs or conjunctions.
Here we regard an ambivalent symbol such as <TT>-</TT>
as denoting two different verbs: monadic negation
or dyadic subtraction.
<p>
Every expression in J has a value of some type.
All values which are not functions
are data (in fact, arrays, as we saw in the previous section).
<p>
In J, data values, that is, arrays, are called "nouns", 
in accordance with the English-grammar analogy.  
We can call something a noun to emphasize that it's not a verb,
or an array to emphasize that it may have several dimensions.
<A NAME="10"></A>
<H2>3.7  Composition of Functions</H2>
Consider the English language expression:
the sum of the squares of the numbers <TT>1 2 3</TT>,
that is, <TT>(1+4+9)</TT>, or <TT>14</TT>.  Since we defined above
verbs for <TT>sum</TT> and <TT>square</TT>, we are in a position to write the J expression as:
<PRE>
<TT>   sum square 1 2 3</TT>
<TT>14</TT>
</PRE>
A single sum-of-the-squares function can be written as a composite of <TT>sum</TT> and <TT>square</TT>:
<PRE>
<TT>   sumsq =: sum @: square</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
<TT>   sumsq 1 2 3</TT>
<TT>14</TT>
</PRE>
The symbol <TT>@:</TT> (at colon) is called a "composition" operator. 
The scheme is that if <TT>f</TT> and <TT>g</TT> are verbs,
then for any argument <TT>y</TT>
<PRE>
<TT>           (f @: g) y    means  f (g y)</TT>
</PRE>
Here is a diagram for the scheme:
<p>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="diag05.gif" ALT="diagram 05" WIDTH=284 HEIGHT=243><BR>
At this point, the reader may be wondering why we write <TT>(f @: g)</TT> and not simply <TT>(f g)</TT> to denote
composition. The short answer is that <TT>(f g)</TT> means something else, which we will come to.
<p>
For another example of composition, a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit can be converted to Celsius by
composing together functions <TT>s</TT> to subtract <TT>32</TT> and <TT>m</TT> tomultiply by <TT>5%9</TT>.
<PRE>
<TT>   s       =: - &amp; 32</TT>
<TT>   m       =: * &amp; (5%9)</TT>
<TT>   convert =: m @: s</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>s 212</TT></TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>180</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>100</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>100</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
For clarity, these examples showed composition of named functions. 
We can of course compose expressions denoting functions:
<PRE>
<TT>   conv =: (* &amp; (5%9)) @: (- &amp; 32) </TT>
<TT>   conv 212</TT>
<TT>100</TT>
</PRE>
We can apply an expression denoting a function, without giving it a name:
<PRE>
<TT>   (* &amp; (5%9)) @: (- &amp; 32)  212</TT>
<TT>100</TT>
</PRE>
The examples above showed composing a monad with a monad. The next example shows we can compose a monad with a dyad.
The general scheme is:
<PRE>
<TT>                   x (f @: g) y   means    f (x g y)</TT>
</PRE>
For example, the total cost of an order for several items is given by multiplying quantities
by corresponding unit prices, and then summing the results. 
To illustrate:
<PRE>
<TT>   P =:  2 3        NB. prices</TT>
<TT>   Q =:  1 100      NB. quantities </TT>
<TT>   </TT>
<TT>   total =: sum @: *</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
</PRE>

<H2>3.8  Trains of Verbs</H2>
Consider the expression "no pain, no gain". This is a compressed idiomatic form, quite comprehensible
even if not grammatical in construction - it is not a sentence, having no main verb.  J has a similar notion:
a compressed idiomatic form, based on a scheme for giving meaning to
short lists of functions.  
We look at this next. 
<A NAME="12"></A>
<H3>3.8.1  Hooks</H3>
Recall the verb <TT>tax</TT> we defined above to compute the amount of tax on
a purchase, at a rate of 10%. The definition is repeated here:
<PRE>
<TT>   tax =: 0.10 &amp; *</TT>
</PRE>
The amount payable on a purchase is the purchase-price plus the computed tax. 
A verb to compute the amount payable can be written:
<PRE>
<TT>   payable =: + tax</TT>
</PRE>
If the purchase price is, say, <TT>$50</TT>, we see:
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>tax 50</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>50 + tax 50</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>payable 50</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>5</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>55</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>55</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
In the definition <TT>(payable =: + tax)</TT> we have a sequence of two verbs
<TT>+</TT> followed by <TT>tax</TT>. 
This sequence is isolated, by being on the right-hand side of the assignment.
Such an isolated sequence of verbs is called a "train", and a train of 2 verbs
is called a "hook".
<p>
We can also form a hook just by isolating the two verbs inside parentheses:
<PRE>
<TT>   (+ tax) 50</TT>
<TT>55</TT>
</PRE>
The general scheme for a hook is that if <TT>f</TT> is a dyad and <TT>g</TT> is a monad, 
then for any argument <TT>y</TT>:
<PRE>
<TT>            (f g) y       means   y f (g y)</TT>
</PRE>
Here is a diagram for the scheme:
<p>
<P>
<IMG SRC="diag06.gif" ALT="diagram 06" WIDTH=235 HEIGHT=227><BR>
For another example, recall that the "floor" verb <TT><.</TT> computes the
 whole-number part of its argument. Then to test whether a number is a 
whole number or not, we can ask whether it is equal to its floor.
A verb meaning "equal-to-its-floor" is the hook <TT>(= <.)</TT> :
<PRE>
<TT>   wholenumber  =:  = <.</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>

<p>
<A NAME="13"></A>
<H3>3.8.2  Forks</H3>
The arithmetic mean of a list of
numbers <TT>L</TT> is given by the sum of <TT>L</TT> divided by 
the number of items in <TT>L</TT>. (Recall that number-of-items is given by the monadic verb <TT>#</TT>.)
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>L =: 3 5 7 9</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>sum L</TT></TD>
<TD><TT># L</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>(sum L) % (# L)</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>3 5 7 9</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>24</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>4</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>6</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
A verb to compute the mean as the sum divided by the number of items
can be written as a sequence of three verbs:
<TT>sum</TT> followed by <TT>%</TT> followed by <TT>#</TT> .
<PRE>
<TT>   mean =: sum % #</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
<TT>   mean L</TT>
<TT>6</TT>
</PRE>
An isolated sequence of three verbs is
called a fork.  The
 general scheme is that if
<TT>f</TT> is a monad,  <TT>g</TT> is a dyad and <TT>h</TT> is a monad
then for any argument y,
<PRE>
<TT>            (f g h) y     means   (f y) g (h y)</TT>
</PRE>
Here is a diagram of this scheme:
<p>
<P>
<IMG SRC="diag08.gif" ALT="diagram 08" WIDTH=295 HEIGHT=244><BR>
For another example of a fork,  what is called the range of numbers in a list
is given by the fork <TT>smallest , largest</TT>  where the middle verb is the comma.
<p>
Recall from <A HREF="01.htm">Chapter 01</A> that the largest number in a list
is given by the verb <TT> >./</TT>  and so the smallest will be given by <TT><./ </TT> 
<PRE>
<TT>   range =: <./  ,  >./</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
</PRE>

<TABLE class=jtable>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>3 5 7 9</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>3 9</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
Hooks and forks are sequences of verbs,
also called "trains" of verbs.
For more about trains, see <A HREF="09.htm">Chapter 09</A>.
<H2>3.9  Putting Things Together</H2>
Let us now try a longer example which puts together several of the ideas we saw above.
<p>
The idea is to define a verb to produce a simple display of a 
given list of numbers, showing for each number what it is as a percentage of the total.  
<p>
Let me begin by showing you a complete program for this example, so you can see 
clearly where we are going. I don't expect you to study this in detail now, because
explanation will be given below. Just note that we are looking at a
 program of 7 lines, defining a verb called <TT>display</TT> and 
its supporting functions.
<PRE>
<TT>   frac     =: % +/</TT>
<TT>   percent  =: (100 &amp; *) @: frac</TT>
<TT>   round    =: <. @: (+ &amp; 0.5)</TT>
<TT>   comp     =: round @: percent</TT>
<TT>   br       =: ,.  ;  (,. @: comp)</TT>
<TT>   tr       =: ('Data';'Percentages') &amp; ,:</TT>
<TT>   display  =: tr @: br</TT>
</PRE>
If we start with some very simple data:
<PRE>
<TT>   data =: 3 1 4</TT>
</PRE>
then we see that the <TT>display</TT> verb shows each number as given 
and as a percentage (in round figures) of the total: <TT>4</TT> is <TT>50%</TT> of <TT>8</TT>.
<PRE>
<TT>   display data</TT>
<TT>+----+-----------+</TT>
<TT>|Data|Percentages|</TT>
<TT>+----+-----------+</TT>
<TT>|3   |38         |</TT>
<TT>|1   |13         |</TT>
<TT>|4   |50         |</TT>
<TT>+----+-----------+</TT>
</PRE>
First, we aim to divide each number by the total, to show the contribution of 
each as a fraction. 
The hook <TT>(% +/)</TT> is suitable: it can be read as divide-by-sum. 
If we call it <TT>frac</TT>   
<PRE>
<TT>   frac =: % +/</TT>
</PRE>
then we see
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>data</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>+/data</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>data % (+/data)</TT></TD>

<TD><TT>0.375 0.125 0.5</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>0.375 0.125 0.5</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
The percentages are given by multiplying the fractions by 100.
<PRE>
<TT>   percent  =: (100 &amp; *) @: frac</TT>
</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>

<TD><TT>0.375 0.125 0.5</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>37.5 12.5 50</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
Let us round the percentages to the nearest whole number,
by adding <TT>0.5</TT> to each and then taking the floor (the integer part)
with the verb <TT><.</TT> The verb <TT>round</TT> is:
<PRE>
<TT>   round    =: <. @: (+&amp;0.5)</TT>
</PRE>
Then the verb to compute the displayed values from the data is:
<PRE>
<TT>   comp     =: round @: percent</TT>
</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>

<TD><TT>comp data</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>37.5 12.5 50</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>38 13 50</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>38 13 50</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
Now we want to show the data and computed 
values in columns. To make a 1-column table out of a list,
we can use the built-in verb <TT>,.</TT> (comma dot, called "Ravel Items").
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>data</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>,. data</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>,. comp data</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>3 1 4</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>3<BR>
1<BR>
4</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>38<BR>
13<BR>
50</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
To make the bottom row of the display, we define
verb <TT>br</TT> as a fork which links together
the data and the computed values, both as columns:
<PRE>
<TT>   br  =: ,.  ;  (,. @: comp)</TT>
</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>data</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>br data</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>3 1 4</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>+-+--+<BR>
|3|38|<BR>
|1|13|<BR>
|4|50|<BR>
+-+--+</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
To add the top row of the display (the column headings), 
there is a useful built-in verb <TT>,:</TT> 
 (comma colon, "Laminate", which will be covered in <A HREF="05.htm">Chapter 05</A>)
<PRE>
<TT>   tr  =: ('Data';'Percentages') &amp; ,:</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>data</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>br data</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>tr br data</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>3 1 4</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>+-+--+<BR>
|3|38|<BR>
|1|13|<BR>
|4|50|<BR>
+-+--+</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>+----+-----------+<BR>
|Data|Percentages|<BR>
+----+-----------+<BR>
|3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<BR>
|1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<BR>
|4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<BR>
+----+-----------+</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
and so we put everything together:
<PRE>
<TT>   display =: tr @: br</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
<TT>   display data</TT>
<TT>+----+-----------+</TT>
<TT>|Data|Percentages|</TT>
<TT>+----+-----------+</TT>
<TT>|3   |38         |</TT>
<TT>|1   |13         |</TT>
<TT>|4   |50         |</TT>
<TT>+----+-----------+</TT>
</PRE>
This <TT>display</TT> verb has two aspects: 
the function <TT>comp</TT> which computes the values 
(the rounded percentages), and
the remainder which is concerned to present the results.
By changing the definition of <TT>comp</TT>, we can <TT>display</TT> a tabulation of the values of 
other functions. Suppose we define <TT>comp</TT> to be the built-in square-root 
verb <TT>(%:)</TT> .
<PRE>
<TT>   comp =: %:</TT>
</PRE>
We would also want to change the column-headings in the top row, 
specified by the <TT>tr</TT> verb:
<PRE>
<TT>   tr   =: ('Numbers';'Square Roots') &amp; ,:</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
<TT>   display 1 4 9 16</TT>
<TT>+-------+------------+</TT>
<TT>|Numbers|Square Roots|</TT>
<TT>+-------+------------+</TT>
<TT>| 1     |1           |</TT>
<TT>| 4     |2           |</TT>
<TT>| 9     |3           |</TT>
<TT>|16     |4           |</TT>
<TT>+-------+------------+</TT>
</PRE>
In review, we have seen a small J program with some characteristic features of J:
bonding, composition, a hook and a fork. As with all J programs, this is only one
of the many possible ways to write it.
<p>
In this chapter we have taken a first look at defining functions. There are two kinds of functions: verbs and operators. So far we have looked only at defining verbs. 
In the next chapter we look at another way of defining verbs, and in <A HREF="13.htm">Chapter 13</A> 
onwards we will look at defining operators. 
<p>
This is the end of Chapter 3.
