 <H1>Chapter 24: Names and Locales</H1>
In this chapter we look at locales.  The interest of locales is twofold:
as a way of organizing large programs, and (as we will come to in the next
chapter) as the basis of object-oriented programming in J.
<H2>24.1  Background</H2>
It is generally agreed that a  
large program is best developed in several parts which are, 
as much as possible, independent of each other.
For example, an independent
part of a larger program might be a collection of statistical functions, 
with its own script-file.
<p>
For the things defined in an independent script,  
we expect to choose names for those things 
more or less freely, 
without regard for what names may be defined in other scripts.
Clearly there may be a problem in combining independent scripts: 
what if the same name accidentally receives different definitions 
in different scripts?  
The J facility of the "locale" gives a way to deal with this problem.
<A NAME="01"></A>
<H2>24.2  What are Locales?</H2>
After entering an assignment of the form <TT>(name =: something)</TT> 
we say we have a definition of <TT>name</TT>.
Every definition is stored in some region of the memory of the J system 
called a "locale". 
Roughly speaking, locales are to definitions as directories are to files.
The important features of locales are:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>There can be several different locales existing at the same time.
<LI>Each locale stores a collection of definitions. 
<LI>The same name can occur at the same time in different locales with 
different definitions.
</UL>
<A NAME="02"></A>
Hence a name of the form
"name <TT>N</TT> as defined in locale <TT>L</TT>" is uniquely defined, without 
conflict. Such a name
can be written as <TT>N_L_</TT> (N underbar L underbar) and is called a 
"locative name". Finally
<UL>
<LI>At any one time, only one locale is current. The current locale is 
the one whose definitions are
available for immediate use.
</UL>
Hence a plain name <TT>N</TT> commonly means 
"<TT>N</TT> as defined in the current locale".
<p>
Locales are neither nouns, verbs, adverbs nor
conjunctions: that is, locales are not values which can be
assigned to variables or be passed as arguments to functions. 
They do have names,
but whenever we need to refer to a locale by name we do so
either with special syntactic forms, (locative names such as
<TT>N_L_</TT>) or by quoting the name to form a string.
<H2>24.3  Example</H2>
Suppose we are interested in the correlation
between the price of whisky and the general level of employee salaries. 
Suppose also that we have available two scripts, 
of independent origin, one with economic data and the 
other with statistical functions.  These script-files
might have been created like this:
<PRE>
<TT>   (0 : 0) (1 !: 2) < 'economic.ijs'</TT>
<TT>y  =: 1932  1934  1957  1969  1972   NB. years</TT>
<TT>s  =: 1000  1000  3000  9000 11000   NB. salaries</TT>
<TT>p  =: 1.59  1.68  2.00  4.50  5.59   NB. prices</TT>
<TT>)</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
<TT>   (0 : 0) (1 !: 2) < 'statfns.ijs'  </TT>
<TT>m =: +/ % #        NB.  Mean          </TT>
<TT>n =: - m           NB.  Norm</TT>
<TT>v =: m @: *: @: n  NB.  Variance                                  </TT>
<TT>s =: %: @: v       NB.  Standard Deviation</TT>
<TT>c =: m @: (*&amp;n)    NB.  Covariance</TT>
<TT>r =: c % (*&amp;s)     NB.  Correlation Coefficient  </TT>
<TT>)</TT>
</PRE>
We aim to load these two scripts, 
and then hope to compute the coefficient of correlation between prices <TT>p</TT>
and salaries <TT>s</TT> as the value of the expression <TT>(p r s)</TT></TT>. 
<p>
Unfortunately we can see that the name <TT>s</TT> 
means different things in the different scripts.
If we were to load both scripts into the same locale, 
one definition of <TT>s</TT> would overwrite the other. 
The remedy is to load the two scripts into different locales.
<p>
There is always a locale named <TT>base</TT>, and by default this is usually 
current.  
We load <TT>economic.ijs</TT> into the current locale (<TT>base</TT>)  
with the built-in verb <TT>(0 !: 0)</TT>.
<PRE>
<TT>   (0 !: 0) < 'economic.ijs'</TT>
</PRE>
<A NAME="03"></A>
Next we load <TT>statfns.ijs</TT> into another locale which we choose
to call, say, <TT>stat</TT>.  To do this  with the minimum
of new apparatus we can use the built-in verb <TT>(18 !: 4)</TT>. 
<PRE>
<TT>   (18 !: 4) < 'stat'</TT>
<TT>   (0 !: 0)  < 'statfns.ijs'</TT>
<TT>   (18 !: 4) < 'base'</TT>
</PRE>
The first line creates the <TT>stat</TT> locale and makes it current. The second 
line loads 
<TT>statfns.ijs</TT> into the now-current locale <TT>stat</TT>. The third line makes 
the <TT>base</TT> locale current again, to restore the status quo.
<p>
At this point our data variables <TT>s</TT> and <TT>p</TT> are available because they 
are in
<TT>base</TT> which is current. The correlation-coefficient
function <TT>r</TT> is not yet available, because it is in 
<TT>stat</TT> which is not current. 
The next step is to define the correlation-coefficient
function to be <TT>r</TT>-as-defined-in-locale- <TT>stat</TT>, using the locative form 
of name
<TT>r_stat_</TT>
<PRE>
<TT>   corr =: r_stat_</TT>
</PRE>
<TT>corr</TT> is available because it has just been defined in <TT>base</TT> 
(because <TT>base</TT> is current).
Everything we need is now available. We can compute the correlation 
between salaries 
and prices.
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>

</TABLE>
<p>
<H3>24.3.1  Review</H3>
What we have seen is the use of locative names to resolve name-conflicts
between independent scripts. What it took was a relatively small amount
of ad-hoc further definition. 
<p>
In this tiny example the conflict was easily identified and could be easily
fixed by editing one of the scripts. However, the point is that we aim
to avoid tampering with independent scripts 
to get them to work together.
<A NAME="04"></A>
<H2>24.4  The Current Locale</H2>
Several locales may coexist, but at any one time
only one is current.  There is a built-in verb
(18 !: 5) which tells us the name of the current locale.
<PRE>
<TT>   (18 !: 5) ''  NB. show name of current locale</TT>
<TT>+----+</TT>
<TT>|base|</TT>
<TT>+----+</TT>
</PRE>
The significance of the current locale is that
it is in the current locale that simple names are evaluated:
<PRE>
<TT>   s</TT>
<TT>1000 1000 3000 9000 11000</TT>
</PRE>
Notice that we get the value of <TT>s</TT> as defined in
script <TT>economic.ijs</TT> which we loaded into <TT>base</TT>, and not the value
of <TT>s</TT> in <TT>statfns.ijs</TT> which was loaded into locale <TT>stat</TT>.
<p>
It is the current locale in which new definitions 
are stored.  To see what names are defined
in the current locale we can use
the built-in verb <TT>(4 !: 1)</TT> with an argument
of <TT>0 1 2 3</TT>. The resulting long list of names 
can be conveniently displayed 
 with the library-verb <TT>list</TT> .  
<PRE>
<TT>   list (4 !: 1) 0 1 2 3  NB. show all names in current locale</TT>
<TT>ASSERTING CH        IP        RUN       RUNR      TD        THIS      </TT>
<TT>and       cd        corr      dir       drop      e         first     </TT>
<TT>fst       hello     implies   indexfile indexing  is_bool   is_box    </TT>
<TT>is_char   is_cmplx  is_extint is_float  is_int    is_list   is_number </TT>
<TT>is_rat    is_real   is_scalar is_string last      most      not       </TT>
<TT>p         print     pwd       rest      run       s         snd       </TT>
<TT>take      thd       y                                                 </TT>
</PRE>
We can define a new verb, and see its name appear in the list:
<PRE>
<TT>   foo  =: +/</TT>
<TT>   list (4 !: 1) 0 1 2 3 </TT>
<TT>ASSERTING CH        IP        RUN       RUNR      TD        THIS      </TT>
<TT>and       cd        corr      dir       drop      e         first     </TT>
<TT>foo       fst       hello     implies   indexfile indexing  is_bool   </TT>
<TT>is_box    is_char   is_cmplx  is_extint is_float  is_int    is_list   </TT>
<TT>is_number is_rat    is_real   is_scalar is_string last      most      </TT>
<TT>not       p         para      print     pwd       rest      run       </TT>
<TT>s         snd       take      thd       y                             </TT>
</PRE>
As we saw above, we can change the current locale with the built-in verb
<TT>(18 !: 4)</TT>.  We can make the <TT>stat</TT> locale current with:
<PRE>
<TT>   (18 !: 4) < 'stat'</TT>
</PRE>
and now we can see what names are defined in this locale
with: 
<PRE>
<TT>    (4 !: 1) 0 1 2 3 </TT>
<TT>+-+-+-+-+-+-+</TT>
<TT>|c|m|n|r|s|v|</TT>
<TT>+-+-+-+-+-+-+</TT>
</PRE>
and return to <TT>base</TT> again
<PRE>
<TT>   (18 !: 4) < 'base'</TT>
</PRE>
<H2>24.5  The z Locale Is Special</H2>
The locale named <TT>z</TT> is special 
in the following sense. 
When a name is evaluated,  
and a definition for that name is not present 
in the current locale, then the <TT>z</TT> locale is automatically
searched for that name.  Here is an example.
We put into locale <TT>z</TT> a definition of a
 variable <TT>q</TT>, say.
<PRE>
<TT>   (18 !: 4) < 'z'</TT>
<TT>   q =: 99</TT>
<TT>   (18 !: 4) < 'base'</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
</PRE>
Now we see that the name <TT>q</TT> is not present in the current
locale (<TT>base</TT>):
<PRE>
<TT>   list (4 !: 1) 0 1 2 3 </TT>
<TT>ASSERTING CH        IP        RUN       RUNR      TD        THIS      </TT>
<TT>and       cd        corr      dir       drop      e         first     </TT>
<TT>foo       fst       hello     implies   indexfile indexing  is_bool   </TT>
<TT>is_box    is_char   is_cmplx  is_extint is_float  is_int    is_list   </TT>
<TT>is_number is_rat    is_real   is_scalar is_string last      most      </TT>
<TT>not       p         para      print     pwd       rest      run       </TT>
<TT>s         snd       take      thd       y                             </TT>
<TT>   </TT>
</PRE>
but nevertheless we can 
evaluate the simple name <TT>q</TT> to get its value as defined in locale <TT>z</TT>.
<PRE>
<TT>   q</TT>
<TT>99</TT>
</PRE>
Since we can find in <TT>z</TT> things which are not in <TT>base</TT>, 
locale <TT>z</TT> is the natural home
for functions of general utility.  On starting a J 
session, locale <TT>z</TT> is automatically populated
with a collection of useful predefined "library" 
functions.
<p>
The names of these functions in the <TT>z</TT> locale are 
all available for
immediate use, and yet the names, of which there are more than 100,
 do not clutter the <TT>base</TT> locale.  
We saw above the use of built-in verbs such as <TT>(18 !: 4)</TT> 
and <TT>(4 !: 1)</TT>. However 
the library verbs of locale <TT>z</TT> are often more convenient. 
Here is a small selection:
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR><TD><TT>coname ''</TT>          </TD><TD> show name of current locale       </TD></TR>
<TR><TD><TT>conl 0</TT>             </TD><TD> show names of all locales         </TD></TR>
<TR><TD><TT>names ''</TT>           </TD><TD> show all names in current locale  </TD></TR>
<TR><TD><TT>nl '' </TT>             </TD><TD> show all names in current locale (as a boxed list)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><TT>cocurrent 'foo'</TT>    </TD><TD> locale <TT>foo</TT> becomes current      </TD></TR>

<TR><TD><TT>coerase 'A';'B';'C'</TT></TD><TD> erase locales <TT>A</TT> <TT>B</TT> and <TT>C</TT></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<p>
We have seen that when a name is not found in the current locale,
the search proceeds automatically to the <TT>z</TT> locale.
In other words, there is what is called a "path" from every locale to
the <TT>z</TT> locale.  We will come back to the subject of paths below.
<A NAME="05"></A>
<H2>24.6  Locative Names and the Evaluation of Expressions</H2>
<H3>24.6.1  Assignments</H3>
An assignment of the form <TT>n_L_ =: something</TT>
assigns the value of <TT>something</TT> to the name <TT>n</TT> in locale <TT>L</TT>.
Locale <TT>L</TT> is created if it does not already exist.
For example:
<PRE>
<TT>   n_L_ =: 7</TT>
</PRE>
creates the name <TT>n</TT> in locale <TT>L</TT> with value <TT>7</TT>.
At this point it will be helpful to introduce
a utility-function to view all the definitions 
in a locale. 
We put this <TT>view</TT> function into locale <TT>z</TT>
:
<PRE>
<TT>   VIEW_z_ =: 3 : '(> ,. ('' =: ''&amp;,)@:(5!:5)"0) nl '''''</TT>
<TT>   view_z_ =: 3 : 'VIEW__lo '''' [ lo =. < y'</TT>
</PRE>
If we make a few more definitions:
<PRE>
<TT>   k_L_ =: 0</TT>
<TT>   n_M_ =: 2</TT>
</PRE>
we can survey what we have in locales <TT>L</TT> and <TT>M</TT>:
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>view 'L'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>view 'M'</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>k =: 0<BR>
n =: 7</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>n =: 2</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
Returning now to the theme of assignments, the scheme is: 
if the current locale is <TT>L</TT>, then 
<TT>(foo_M_ =: something)</TT>  means:
<p>
<OL>
<LI> evaluate <TT>something</TT> in locale <TT>L</TT> to get value <TT>V</TT> say.
<LI> <TT>cocurrent 'M'</TT>
<LI> <TT>foo =: V</TT>
<LI> <TT>cocurrent 'L'</TT>
</OL>
For example:
<PRE>
<TT>   cocurrent 'L'</TT>
</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>view 'L'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>view 'M'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>k_M_ =: n-1</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>view 'M'</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>k =: 0<BR>
n =: 7</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>n =: 2</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>6</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>k =: 6<BR>
n =: 2</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
<H3>24.6.2  Evaluating Names</H3>
Now we look at locative names occurring in expressions.
The scheme (call this scheme 2) is: 
if the current locale is <TT>L</TT> then <TT>(n_M_)</TT> means
<p>
<OL>
<LI> <TT>cocurrent 'M'</TT>
<LI> evaluate the name <TT>n</TT> to get a value <TT>V</TT>
<LI> <TT>cocurrent 'L'</TT>
<LI> <TT>V</TT>
</OL>
<p>
For example:
<PRE>
<TT>   cocurrent 'L'</TT>
</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>view 'L'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>view 'M'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>n_M_</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>k =: 0<BR>
n =: 7</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>k =: 6<BR>
n =: 2</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>2</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
<H3>24.6.3  Applying Verbs</H3>
Consider the expression <TT>(f_M_ n)</TT>.
This means: function <TT>f</TT> (as defined in locale <TT>M</TT>)
applied to an argument <TT>n</TT> (as defined in the current locale)
In this case, the application of <TT>f</TT> to <TT>n</TT> 
takes place in locale <TT>M</TT>. Here is an example:
<PRE>
<TT>   u_M_ =: 3 : 'y+k'</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
<TT>   cocurrent 'L'</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>view 'L'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>view 'M'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>u_M_ n</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>k =: 0<BR>
n =: 7</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>k =: 6<BR>
n =: 2<BR>
u =: 3 : 'y+k'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>13</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
We see that the argument <TT>n</TT> comes from the current locale
<TT>L</TT>, but the constant <TT>k</TT> comes from
the locale (<TT>M</TT>) from which we took verb <TT>u</TT>.
The scheme (call it scheme 3) is: 
if the current locale is <TT>L</TT> , 
then <TT>(f_M_ something)</TT> 
means:
<p>
<OL> 
<LI> evaluate <TT>something</TT> in <TT>L</TT> to get a value <TT>V</TT> say
<LI> <TT>cocurrent 'M'</TT>
<LI> in locale <TT>M</TT>, evaluate the expression <TT>f V</TT>  to get
      a value <TT>R</TT> say
<LI> <TT>cocurrent 'L'</TT>
<LI> <TT>R</TT>
</OL>
<p>
Here is another example.  The verb <TT>g</TT>
is taken from the same locale in which <TT>f</TT> is found:
<PRE>
<TT>   g_L_ =: +&amp;1</TT>
<TT>   g_M_ =: +&amp;2</TT>
<TT>   f_M_ =: g</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
<TT>   cocurrent 'L'</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>view 'L'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>view 'M'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>f_M_ k</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>g =: +&amp;1<BR>

n =: 7</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>f =: g<BR>

Suppose <TT>A_X_</TT> is an adverb in locale <TT>X</TT>.
The application of <TT>A_X_</TT> to an argument takes 
place in locale <TT>X</TT> rather than in the current locale.
<p>
To demonstrate this, we start by entering  definitions in fresh locales
<TT>X</TT> and <TT>Y</TT>.
<PRE>
<TT>   A_X_ =: 1 : 'u &amp; k'    NB. an adverb</TT>
<TT>   k_X_ =: 17</TT>
<TT>   k_Y_ =: 6</TT>
</PRE>
now make <TT>Y</TT> the current locale:
<PRE>
<TT>   cocurrent 'Y'</TT>
</PRE>
and apply adverb <TT>A_X_</TT> to argument <TT>+</TT> .
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>view 'X'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>view 'Y'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>+ A_X_</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>A =: 1 : 'u &amp; k'<BR>
k =: 17</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>k =: 6</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>+&amp;17</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
Evidently the result is produced by taking <TT>k</TT>
from locale <TT>X</TT> rather than from the current locale which is <TT>Y</TT>.
<p>
The scheme is that if the current locale is <TT>Y</TT>, 
and <TT>A</TT> is an adverb, the expression
<TT>f A_X_</TT> means:
<p>
<OL>
<LI> evaluate <TT>f</TT> in locale <TT>Y</TT> to get a value <TT>F</TT> say. 
<LI> cocurrent <TT>X</TT>
<LI> evaluate <TT>F A</TT> in locale <TT>X</TT> to get a result <TT>G</TT> say. 
<LI> cocurrent <TT>Y</TT>
<LI> <TT>G</TT>
</OL>
<A NAME="06"></A>
<H2>24.7  Paths</H2>
Recall that the <TT>z</TT> locale contains useful "library" functions, and that 
we said there is
a path from any locale to <TT>z</TT>.
<p>
We can inspect the path from a 
locale 
with the library verb <TT>copath</TT>; 
we expect the path from locale <TT>base</TT> to be just <TT>z</TT>. 
<PRE>
<TT>   copath 'base'   NB. show path</TT>
<TT>+-+</TT>
<TT>|z|</TT>
<TT>+-+</TT>
</PRE>
A path is represented as a
(list of) boxed string(s). We can build our own structure of search-paths 
between locales. We will give <TT>base</TT> a path to
<TT>stat</TT> and then to <TT>z</TT>, using dyadic <TT>copath</TT>.
<PRE>
<TT>   ('stat';'z') copath 'base'</TT>
</PRE>
and check the result is as expected:
<PRE>
<TT>   copath 'base'</TT>
<TT>+----+-+</TT>
<TT>|stat|z|</TT>
<TT>+----+-+</TT>
</PRE>
With this path in place, we can, while <TT>base</TT> 
is current, find names in <TT>base</TT>, <TT>stat</TT>
and <TT>z</TT>.
<PRE>
<TT>   cocurrent 'base'</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
<TT>   s     NB. in base</TT>
<TT>1000 1000 3000 9000 11000</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
<TT>   r     NB. in stat</TT>
<TT>c % *&amp;s</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
<TT>   q     NB. in z</TT>
<TT>99</TT>
</PRE>
Suppose we set up a path from <TT>L</TT> to <TT>M</TT>.  Notice
that we want every path to terminate at locale <TT>z</TT>, 
(otherwise we may lose access to the useful
stuff in <TT>z</TT>) so we make the path go from <TT>L</TT> to <TT>M</TT>
to <TT>z</TT>.
<PRE>
<TT>   ('M';'z') copath 'L'</TT>
</PRE>
If we access a name along a path,
there is no change of current locale. Compare
the effects of referring to verb <TT>u</TT>
via a locative name and searching for <TT>u</TT> along a 
path. 
<PRE>
<TT>   cocurrent 'L'</TT>
</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>view 'L'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT> view 'M'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>u_M_ 0</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>u 0</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>g =: +&amp;1<BR>
k =: 0<BR>
n =: 7</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>f =: g<BR>
g =: +&amp;2<BR>
k =: 6<BR>
n =: 2<BR>
u =: 3 : 'y+k'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>6</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>0</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
We see that in evaluating <TT>(u_M_ 0)</TT> there is a change of 
locale to <TT>M</TT>, so that the variable <TT>k</TT> is picked up
with its value in <TT>M</TT> of 6.  In evaluating <TT>(u 0)</TT>, where <TT>u</TT>
is found along the path, the variable <TT>k</TT> is picked up from the 
current locale, with its value in <TT>L</TT> of <TT>0</TT>.
<p>
When a name is found along a path, it is as though
the definition were temporarily copied into
the current locale. Here is another example.
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>view 'L'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT> view 'M'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>f_M_ 0</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>f 0</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>g =: +&amp;1<BR>
k =: 0<BR>
n =: 7</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>f =: g<BR>
g =: +&amp;2<BR>
k =: 6<BR>
n =: 2<BR>
u =: 3 : 'y+k'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>2</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>1</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
<H2>24.8  Combining Locatives and Paths</H2>
We sometimes want to populate a locale
with definitions from a script-file.
 We saw above one way to do this:
in three steps:
<p>
(1) use <TT>cocurrent</TT> (or <TT>18 !: 4</TT>) to move to the 
specified locale.
<p>
(2) execute the script-file with <TT>0!:0</TT>
<p>
(3) use <TT>cocurrent</TT> (or <TT>18 !: 4</TT>) to return to the original locale.
<p>
A neater way is as follows. We first define:
<PRE>
<TT>   POP_z_ =: 0 !: 0</TT>
</PRE>
and then to populate locale <TT>Q</TT> 
say, from file <TT>economic.ijs</TT>,  we can write:
<PRE>
<TT>   POP_Q_ < 'economic.ijs'</TT>
</PRE>
which works like this:
<p>
<OL>
<LI> The <TT>POP</TT> verb is defined in locale <TT>z</TT>.
<LI> Encountering <TT>POP_Q_ < ...</TT> the system makes locale 
<TT>Q</TT> temporarily current, creating <TT>Q</TT> if it does not already exist.
<LI>The system looks for a definition of <TT>POP</TT>.  
It does not find it in <TT>Q</TT>
, because <TT>POP</TT> is of course defined in locale <TT>z</TT>.
<LI>The system then looks along the path from <TT>Q</TT> 
to <TT>z</TT> and finds <TT>POP</TT>.  Note that the current locale
is still (temporarily) <TT>Q</TT>.
<LI> The <TT>POP</TT> verb is applied to its argument, in 
temporarily-current locale <TT>Q</TT>.
<LI> The current locale is automatically restored to
whatever it was beforehand.
</OL>
Back to base. (If we are nipping about between locales it is advisable to 
keep
track of where we are.)
<PRE>
<TT>   cocurrent <'base'</TT>
</PRE>
<A NAME="07"></A>
<H2>24.9  Indirect Locatives</H2>
A variable can hold the name of a locale as a 
boxed string. For example, given that <TT>M</TT> is a 
locale,
<PRE>
<TT>   loc =: < 'M'</TT>
</PRE>
Then a locative name such as <TT>k_M_</TT> can be
written equivalently in the form <TT>k__loc</TT> 
(u underscore underscore loc)
<PRE>
<TT>   k_M_</TT>
<TT>6</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
<TT>   k__loc</TT>
<TT>6</TT>
</PRE>
The point of this indirect form is that it
makes it convenient to supply locale-names as arguments to functions.
<PRE>
<TT>   NAMES =: 3 : 0</TT>
<TT>locname =. < y</TT>
<TT>names__locname ''</TT>
<TT>)</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
<TT>   NAMES 'L'</TT>
<TT>g k n </TT>
<TT>   </TT>
</PRE>
<A NAME="08"></A>
<H2>24.10  Erasing Names from Locales</H2>
Suppose we create a variable with the name <TT>var</TT>, say, 
<PRE>
<TT>   var =: 'hello'</TT>
</PRE>
and demonstrate that it exists, that is, that the name <TT>var</TT> is
one of the names in the namelist of the <TT>base</TT> locale:
<PRE>
<TT>   (<'var') e. nl_base_ ''</TT>
<TT>1</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
</PRE>
Now we can erase it with the <TT>erase</TT> library verb: 
<PRE>
<TT>   erase <'var'</TT>
<TT>1</TT>
</PRE>
and demonstrate that it no longer exists
<PRE>
<TT>   (<'var') e. nl_base_ ''</TT>
<TT>0</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
</PRE>
Now suppose that we create a variable <TT>foo</TT>, say, 
in the base
locale, and another, also called <TT>foo</TT>, in the <TT>z</TT> locale.
Recall that there is always a path from <TT>base</TT> to <TT>z</TT>
<PRE>
<TT>   foo    =: 'hello'</TT>
<TT>   foo_z_ =: 'goodbye'</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
</PRE>
we demonstrate they both exist:
<PRE>
<TT>   (<'foo') e. nl_base_ ''</TT>
<TT>1</TT>
<TT>   (<'foo') e. nl_z_ ''</TT>
<TT>1</TT>
<TT>   </TT>
</PRE>
erase <TT>foo</TT> from <TT>base</TT>, demonstrate that it has gone 
but that <TT>foo</TT> in <TT>z</TT> is still there:
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>erase <'foo'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>(<'foo') e. nl_base_ '' </TT></TD>
<TD><TT>(<'foo') e. nl_z_ ''</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>1</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>0</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>1</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
Now if we erase again, <TT>foo</TT> will be found along 
the path and erased from <TT>z</TT>.
<p>
<TABLE class=jtable>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>erase <'foo'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>(<'foo') e. nl_base_ '' </TT></TD>
<TD><TT>(<'foo') e. nl_z_ ''</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>1</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>0</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>0</TT></TD>
