<h1>Order of evaluation</h1>
What is the answer if the parentheses are left out?<br>

<pre>   10 - 4 - 3
9</pre>
J evaluates the sentence as:<br>

<pre>   10 - (4 - 3)
9
</pre>
Most other languages would evaluate it as:<br>

<pre>   (10 - 4) - 3
3</pre>
In the absence of parentheses, J implicitly provides them from the right towards the left. Other languages provide them from the left towards the right. A longer sentence will make this visually clearer.<br>

<pre>   10 - 4 - 3 - 1
8
   10 - (4 - (3 - 1))	NB. J right-to-left
8
   ((10 - 4) - 3) - 1	NB. others left-to-right
2</pre>
 Now consider a sequence of monadic verbs.<br>

<pre>   - - - 4
_4</pre>
Everyone knows how to parenthesize this, and every language does it the same.<br>

<pre>   - (- (- 4))
_4</pre>
The grouping is done right-to-left and in this case the other languages agree with J. J always parenthesizes from right-to-left, whereas other languages have different rules for different situations.<br>
<br>
J has a right-to-left order of evaluation. Most other languages have a left-to-right order of evaluation for dyads, right-to-left for monads; and this is modified by the relative precedence of the verbs involved.<br>
<br>
With nouns and verbs the J evaluation rule from J Dictionary section E is:
<blockquote>Execution proceeds from right to left, except that when a right parenthesis is encountered, the segment enclosed by it and its matching left parenthesis is executed, and its result replaces the entire segment and its enclosing parentheses.<br>
</blockquote>
There are things in J, other than nouns and verbs, that you have not yet met that complicate this rule by adding a few more. It is these additional classes that largely justify the J break with tradition and adoption of a right-to-left evaluation.To further quote from the J Dictionary section E:
<blockquote>One important consequence of these rules is that in an unparenthesized expression the right argument of any verb is the result of the entire phrase to its right.</blockquote>
This is due to the lack of verb precedence as well as right-to-left evaluation.<br>
<br>
No verb precedence, right-to-left evaluation, and the rules for the other classes make the overall evaluation rules simple, reduce the need for parentheses, and make sentences easier for an experienced J user to read and write.<br>
<br>
Read the following sentences, evaluate them in your head, and understand how the no precedence and right-to-left rules explain the answer.<br>

<pre>    2 * 4 + 5
18
   2 + 4 * 5
22
   2 - 4 - 5
3
   8 % 2 + 2
2</pre>
Remember: no verb precedence and right-to-left evaluation.<br>
