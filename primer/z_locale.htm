<h1>z locale</h1>
The <font face=courier size=-1>z</font> locale is the <em>parent locale</em> of all other locales.<br>
<br>
If a name is not found in the current locale, and there is a definition for it in the <font face=courier size=-1>z</font> locale, then that definition is used as if it were in the current locale.<br>
<br>
The <font face=courier size=-1>z</font> locale is for common utilities that you want to be available everywhere. From the <font face=courier size=-1>z</font> locale, they are available for execution in any locale as if they were in that locale, yet there is only a single copy, and the names in the z locale don't clutter up the names in the other locales.<br>
<br>
The profile.ijs that runs when you start J defines many standard utilities in the <font face=courier size=-1>z</font> locale. You have used both the erase and the names verbs which are defined in the <font face=courier size=-1>z</font> locale. You can tell this by the following:<br>

<pre>   names 3	NB. verbs in the base locale
...
</pre>
The above does not list names as a name, yet you are able to execute it. This is because when it is not found in the base locale, its definition from the <font face=courier size=-1>z</font> locale is used as if it were in fact defined in the base locale.<br>

<pre>   names_z_ 3	NB. verbs in z locale
...
</pre>
The result is too long to list here. The verb names has a dyadic definition that takes a left argument which indicates the first letter of names to return.<br>

<pre>    'n' names_z_ 3
