<TR valign="baseline"><TD><H1>Connection and Statement Handles</h1>
<TR><TD colspan="2"> 


<P>
You start accessing a database by first opening a connection to the data source. The result is a number, called the <I>connection handle</I>. Subsequent requests to the data source use this connection handle.

<P>
When you send a request to select some data, the result is also a number, called the <I>statement handle</I>. Again, subsequent requests that reference this selection use the statement handle. There may be more than one statement handle associated with a connection handle. You may also have a statement handle not associated with a connection handle, where the request made was not specific to a particular data file.

<P>
In both cases, you should close the handle to free up resources when you are finished with it. For example, to read records from a file, you typically:<br>
<br>
<li>open a connection to the data source, returning a connection handle<br>
<li>make a selection on a specific file using the connection handle, returning a statement handle<br>
<li>read the records, using the statement handle<br>
<li>close the statement handle<br>
<li>close the connection handle

<P>
You must always close a connection handle explicitly. However, a statement handle may be closed if you have fetched all records selected - see the discussion of <code>ddfet</code> below. In any case, it is good practice to always close the statement handle explicitly, as there is no harm done if you try to close a handle that had already been closed.
